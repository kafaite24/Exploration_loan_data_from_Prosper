# data_visualizion

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to create data visualization using Python that tells a story
or highlights trends or patterns in the dataset.

## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan. Unwanted variables were
removed outliers were also removed to provide more reliable dataset.

Our focus will be majorly on analyzing factors that could influence borrower's APR.
3 types of analysis will be performed on the various variables to better find their effects on our
key feature or relation among themselves; univariate, bivariate, multivariate.

## Summary
After analyzing each variable, we concluded that:

BorrowerAPR and ProsperScore are the most highly corelated but negatively.

BorrowerAPR is most effected by ProsperScore, followed by AvailableBankcardCredit. 

Borrowers with the lowest rating(HR) received higher Borrower’s APR
percentage, and borrower with high rating (A) received lower APR percentage, that is
borrowers with better ratings have larger monthly income and loan amount.

## Key Insights

As our targeted variable to investigate was Borrower’s APR and during exploratory analysis we
found that ProsperScore was most highly correlated so I chose those main graphs that focused
on the main investigative variable. I tried to include all types of graphs, univariate, bivariate and
multivariate to show diversity and how BorrowerAPR was investigated in all aspects with all
major features.
